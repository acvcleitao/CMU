Run Backend in server, then run LibrarIST in Android Studio.
It's assumed that the libraries' systems aren't connected and thus there can be different books with the same barcode on different libraries. The barcode is unique to each book on a given library.

The backend saves all data in a global list and sends it over using a json object. This json object is converted to a dictionary by the client which then uses its content.

All mandatory features are implemented except the following
 - A button to help the user navigate to the library.
	- The button exists, it does nothing.

No additional components were implemented


Note: I was the only person involved in this project. My group collegues David Daniel Oliveira Cruz (89377) and Guilherme Rodrigues de Carvalho (96868) did not contribute to this application in any way.
